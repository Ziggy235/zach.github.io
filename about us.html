   <center> <h1 id="heading"> THE Z-Max Project </h1></center>
    </div>
    <p> This is one of the new project that came to mind while preparing for web development class during summer coaching, on my way back after one of the session that got me thinking which I speak about later in my write up,  I was thinking on what happening in my environment and how I can be of help, thinking further I realize that what the community lack is knowledge and skills, everybody is just doing what they think is right weather wrong or right without anybody causing them distress or correcting. I saw this and a thought came to mind although it was not the first time am gathering the teenagers and the youth in the environment to speak to them, I have several time on different occasion but most times they are always not responding to what is been taught but am not discourage about it, because I know learning and unlearning takes time. So I persistently do it again and again but with time for no reason I stopped and start focusing and building myself and boom everything came back to its old form everyone of them got back to what they were doing earlier and I was discourage to even speak to any of them again, I start having the mindset of what they are doing is their business and what I am doing is my business and I moved on until this day during the training at web development class one morning the anchor for photography class gave a spoken words and said something pertaining to why you need to give back to your community, your growth is measured my those you were able to lift said he, that word touched me and I taught of the project “the z-max project” maximizing oko-agbon, which was to empower at least one hundred teenagers with digital skill but at the other side it got me thinking how will this become a reality because I don’t have a dine with me but I taught of one thing why don’t I draft out everything about the project and when sponsor comes we starts.
        I started by researching on the kind of digital skill to teach those that will be coming for the training and I got some which are </p>
        <ul>

        <li>Coding</li> 
        <li>Digital marketing </li>
       <li> Copy writing </li>
        <li>Graphic design </li>
        <li>Web development</li>
        
        </ul>
      <P>  Having the mind of twenty students in a class, the plan was to take them through the very basics and those who will be serious with the class will be empowered and given the privilege to upskill and learn more about the skill they have chosen.
        So after that day  I discuss the project idea with one of my friend who was also in the class and she agree but we have not really started anything then but she gave her word to always support the project because she was also a resident in this community.
        The aim of this project is to involve the leaders of the environment and tell them about the project and educate these teenagers parent about the importance of this project, because most of their parent count anything not tailoring, hairdressing etc not a skill but getting the leaders involve will bring this teenagers in with full approval from their parents without much thinking.
        The project will be a continuous one that is every year we get to recruit new members skill them and send them to the outside world to prosper, while prospering you come back and give to your community and with that I think we will have a better community for the generations to come.
