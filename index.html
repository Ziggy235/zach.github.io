    <h1><b><center> STAYING POSITIVE IN A NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENT </center> <b></h1>
   
   
        <p> In checking today's world we will see that teenagers in the slum are easily influenced with the bad example in the environment.All because their parents were not able to give them  the write parenting.
    Most parents in my region (oko agbon) believe that as  children grows they will get to figure out things  themselves no need to teach core values, later the years the parent will see such child and won't be happy with them,
     but now we are seeing parent complying with this method of bringing up children who are well trained and well equipped in our societies but lack skill.
    <br> <br>The major problem faced by these children is peer presure,  always wanting to do what every other everybody is doing, which is bringing
    about these children doing the unexpected in the environment e.g stealing money, yahoo boys and all others. So for us to bring things
    to order we need to first work on the parent and then enlighten the young on the steps to take. </center></p>
    
    <p> From time we've seen parent who use abusive words on their children e.g like causing them and comparing them to their friends which as put bad experience <br> on this
    children, i have learnt with time that children don't easily forget bad words spoken to them while they grow so also the good words, those word create a large 
    mark on such child to be remembered always, so as parent let learn to speak the right words to our children because those words we say can make them or destroy them, this remind me of a
    young girl in my community who got pregnated at an early age and she left school to take futher treatment on herself, by God grace after she gave birth and start 
    nurturing her child, with the help of her parent she got some wares for the child but after a while the parent starting her to leave and go to the house of the person that impregnated her.
    Why am i qouting this story because it taught me alot of lesson in life e.g<br>
      <ul> 
        <li> Don't get into what you are not prepared for. </li>
        <li> Learn to listen to people who are older than you, because their counsel brings light. </li>
        <li> Learn to be outspoken, when things are wrong don't keep them to yourself tell a trusted adult. </li>
        <li> In whatever area you are in life, learn to stay focus minding your business. </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2><b><center>THE ROLE OF PARENT IN CHILD'S GROWTH</center></b></h2>
    <p> Parent most times get it wrong in bringing up their children, the father will think the growth of the child is only dependent on the mother
        while the mother will also be thinking that  all the financing in the house is for only the father, which is a very wrong mindset.<br> So we are writing this to
        bring enlightenment to parent how they ought to cooperate to bring the best out of their child. In todays world we will see alot of teenage
        pregnacy around the reason be that those children were not informed about the necessary things they need to know, so many parents
        find it irritating to give their children sex talk but later the child will find the wrong perspective of it from friends and continue in that 
        manner before the parents could know it already pregnacy. So parent will need to first show their children the very best example of what
        they want their children become, if you don’t want your child do some certain things don’t do it in their presence because the moment she start 
        seeing you do it, now or later she will do same.<br>  We have alot going on in this country, so if want your child to stand out among their friends in learning new ideaology
        and working on it to get better click the link below. Thank you
